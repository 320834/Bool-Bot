# Pull Requests

Do not push the master branch if you are working on a feature

Always create a branch and submit a pull request to merge it to master

The convention we will set for branch names will be 

<em>your name/type of branch/short description</em>

Your Name: Literally your name
Type of Branch: What is this branch about. Is it a feature, bug fix, documentation etc
Description: The description of the branch

Ex. If I (Justin) were to implement a feature such that it sends a photo every one minute, the name would be...

**justin/feature/photo-every-minute**

Steps for contributing

1. git checkout -b <em>branch name here</em>
2. Do your code changes here
3. git add <em>the files you want to stage</em>
4. git commit -m "Your commit message"
5. git push (You might need to set the head here. Just follow the instructions provided by git)
6. On github, find your branch and submit a pull request. 
7. Add people to review your code.
