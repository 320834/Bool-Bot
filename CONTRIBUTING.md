index.py - The main driver of the program. Always run this
settings.py - Configuration file. Used for discord api key

example_feature - A example of feature file. Defined so it serves as a template for other features

# Pull Requests

Do not push to master branch if you are working on a feature

Always create a branch and submit a pull request to merge it to master

The convention we will set for branch names will be 

<em>your name/type of branch/short description</em>

Your Name: Literally your name

Type of Branch: What is this branch about. Is it a feature, bug fix, documentation etc

Description: The description of the branch

Ex. If I (Justin) were to implement a feature such that it sends a photo every one minute, the name would be...

**justin/feature/photo-every-minute**
